Use Case: Support Ticket Classification for a SaaS Company
Problem:
A SaaS company receives thousands of support tickets per week. Support agents manually read and assign each ticket to a category like:
  Technical Issue
  Billing
  Login Issues
  General Inquiry
  Product Guidance

This takes time and leads to delays.

Goal:
Automatically classify each incoming ticket into the appropriate category using classical NLP (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression).
