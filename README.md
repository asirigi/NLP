Use Case: Support Ticket Classification for a SaaS Company
Problem:
A SaaS company receives thousands of support tickets per week. Support agents manually read and assign each ticket to a category like:

🔧 Technical Issue

💳 Billing

🔐 Login Issues

💬 General Inquiry

🧠 Product Guidance

This takes time and leads to delays.

Goal:
Automatically classify each incoming ticket into the appropriate category using classical NLP (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression).
